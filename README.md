# obo-community-health

Check the OBO Foundry repositories to see what's going on. To run this, you'll need either the `GITHUB_TOKEN`
environment variable set up with a github token, or any other valid way to specify the `token` key in the `github`
namespace via [`pystow`](https://github.com/cthoyt/pystow). Installation and running is handled with `tox`. Run with the
following lines in your shell:

```shell
$ pip install tox
$ tox
```
